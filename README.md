# skycrane
A small program to control a very large claw machine over Twitch

plan:
twitch returns list of string inputs

parser reads in list of string inputs and translates to commands.
	could be decided by votes or just randomly pick one
	second is probably better

controller reads in list of commands and translates into movements.
